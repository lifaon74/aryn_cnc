# Aryn CNC

Aryn CNC is a personal project of building a CNC machine for 3D printing, carving, or PCB drilling.
The final should result in a low cost "professional" CNC tool able to work in 50cm x 50cm x 40cm volume (X, Y, Z).

## The goals:
* **modular** : easy to add, remove and update parts => it's for me the most important goal.
* **professional** : fast, precise and strong, that's why I choosed to use only high quality materials. It increase the price, but he, we want the best no ?
* **low cost** : far under the professional market (price estimated around 500$) but with same or better results.
* **important work volume** : 50cm x 50cm x 40cm (aprox) into a 70cm side cube (you should be able to put it in your car). It's a far better ratio than most of the 3D printer (ex: [Haeckel](http://reprap.org/wiki/Haeckel) 47cm x 47cm x 57cm size for a 20cm x 20cm x 35cm print volume)
* **for makers** : if you have time, are handyman and like to trade with resellers (most of the parts are not available into generic DIY store, you'll need to order them online and/or contact peoples, finally you'll need a shitload of screws and nuts).

**The project is still in progress, some parts may change and it's not my full time job (don't expect it will be finished too fast). This git is here to share my work. Fell free to test, contribute, improve or comment (create issues for that).**
