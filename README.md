# Aryn CNC

Aryn CNC is a personal project of building a CNC machine for 3D printing, carving, or PCB drilling.
The final should result in a low cost "professional" CNC tool able to work in 50cm x 50cm x 40cm cube (X, Y, Z).

## The goals:
* **modular** : easy to add, remove and update parts => it's for me the main important goal.
* **professional** : fast, precise and the with the best materials .
* **low cost** : far under the professional market (estimated around 500$) but with same or better results.

**The project is still in progress, some parts may change and it's not my full time job (don't expect it will be finished fast). This git is here to share my work. Fell free to test, contribute, improve or comment (create issues for that).**
